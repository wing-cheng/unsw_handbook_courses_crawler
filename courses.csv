ARTS2210,"Modern India: Violence and Nonviolence in Colonial South Asia, 1750-1947",https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2020/ARTS2210/,Term 3,Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1,http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/,"In this course you will study the history of British colonialism and the movement for independence in India, focussing on the key question: if the struggle for freedom in India was conducted along Gandhian lines according to the principles of non-violence, then how can we understand the extent of violence that accompanied decolonisation, in 1947? The course answers this question by moving beyond the dominant tropes of the British Raj, replete with civilising missions, bejewelled maharajas and tiger hunts, to present a critical interrogation of colonial dynamics, demonstrating the relationships between imperial oppression, anti-colonial violence and Gandhian nonviolence, which culminated in the independence of India and the creation of East and West Pakistan, in 1947. The course engages with narratives of imperialism embedded in contemporary and historical popular cultures, from Raj Nostalgia to Bollywood film, seeking to align these with academic and public debates about history. We will reflect on the legacies of violence and nonviolence in India, and on the enduring impact of imperialism in the region. "
ARTS2211,East Asia,https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2020/ARTS2211/,Term 1,Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1,http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/,"This course focuses on interactions among China, Korea, and Japan; their relations with the West; and the issue of culture and civilization in the post-nation-state era. The course is organized thematically. It starts by framing East Asia in terms of its history of globalization through cultural and religious interaction. The course then turns to fundamental cultural commonalities centring on statecraft, institutions, education and notions of civilization that united and divided the region. Cross cultural comparisons among China, Japan, and Korea highlight the global and regional dimensions of cultural change in East Asia. These frame cultural similarities and differences that influenced the varying approaches to modernity taken by Chinese, Japanese and Korean activists when East Asia came under increasing pressure from the West. The formation of nation-state ideologies along Western lines led to evolving conceptions of their place in the world, the meaning of culture, the role of commerce, and the relationship of the individual to the state. But in the era of globalization, these issues are situated in a post-nation-state framework."
ARTS2212,Southeast Asia,https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2020/ARTS2212/,Term 3,Prerequisite: 24 units of credit at Level 1,http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/,"The course focuses on modern Southeast Asia since the end of the colonial period until the present day. Instead of the traditional interpretation, which sees a trend towards authoritarianism, we shall read history and politics in contemporary Southeast Asia as an unresolved conflict between two competing systems -- dictatorship and democracy. The authoritarian regimes of Marcos, Suharto (including the 1965 killings in Indonesia), Mahathir, Lee Kuan Yew, the Khmer Rouge, Burma/Myanmar, the monarchy and military in Thailand, and Vietnam since 1989 will provide some case studies through which to analyse Southeast Asian political dynamics, including corruption, nepotism, social movements, the impact of the Internet and Facebook trolls on elections, the rise of populist leaders, and the links between religion and politics.

Such development is often seen a synonym of progress; however, over the past few decades it has been increasingly recognised that such rapid change has produced an uneven social geography – marginalising significant populations – while also intensively degrading and polluting different environments. We will discuss how the idea of sustainable development has emerged as a response to this conundrum – an effort to redirect economic growth to produced more socially just and environmentally benign outcomes. The path to a sustainable future, however, is not straightforward, as environmental, social and economic issues are ultimately situated in contested political realms. In this course, you will study how human-environment interconnections, across different scales and in different contexts, come together to demonstrate how environmental issues are situated in, and shaped by political and economic contexts. This will include engaging with a number of key sustainability debates as well as the in-depth study of different examples from around the world."

In this course we will explore how climate change is perhaps better understood as a social, cultural and political phenomenon which is remaking the ways in which we understand our relationship with the Earth. How we understand climate, weather, nature and the environment are crucial for understanding contemporary global warming and our responses to it. We will examine the underlying politics of climate change. You will garner a conceptual and methodological toolkit for interpreting and making sense of the social aspects of climate change and the often intense political arguments that surround it. The course explores the history of climate science and the more recent emergence of a global consensus on anthropogenic global warming. The course goes on to consider recent work on abrupt climate change, climate modelling and the politics of climate change adaptation and mitigation technologies. The course draws on a multi-disciplinary framework for understanding the social, historical and political aspects of climate change, with insights from politics, sociology, and science and technical studies (STS). You will be introduced to key areas of contemporary scholarly thinking in the environmental humanities – including political ecology, the sociology of scientific knowledge and contemporary political theory."

This course provides you with critical perspectives to examine this natural disasters/society interface. The emphasis of the course is focused on natural disasters being better understood as social disasters with natural triggers. Thus, in the course you will develop an understanding of how forms of social vulnerability to hazards emerge and shape subsequent disaster impacts. You will also examine how natural disasters are disruptive events that can critically jolt and shape future social, economic and political outcomes in the context of governance and politics. In the first half of the course you will examine different theories and frameworks for understanding disasters. This will provide a critical platform for the second part of the course, where you will focus on different thematic areas of disasters governance and society, using case study disasters from around the world."

In this course you will explore how these issues were fostered by the major themes of Australia’s 19th century history: the settler revolution, Indigenous dispossession and resistance, and the rise of scientific racism on the one hand; movements towards democracy, universal education and better living standards on the other. Tensions arising from these themes are common to all settler societies but Australia’s location at the edge of Asia means they were played out here with a distinctive sense of urgency whose reverberations persist."

This course examines her life and artistic production, and seeks to account for her status in Mexican and Latin American circles as well as in a broad international context. It emphasizes the self-consciously theatrical ways in which Kahlo’s work projects particular versions of the following general themes: ethnicity and ""Mexicanness""; gender and sexuality; public and private selves; the body fragmented and in pain; and radical leftwing politics. In addition to discussing several dozen of Kahlo’s paintings, we also examine two feature films: Frida: Naturaleza viva (1984) directed by Paul Leduc, and the Hollywood production Frida (2002) directed by Julie Taymor."

By starting in the Ancient world, you will learn that people and societies have not always understood sexual behaviour to equate with a sexual identity, such as ‘homosexual’ or ‘heterosexual’. ‘Sexuality’ then is a modern phenomenon. To comprehend this, we will examine why masturbation suddenly became a very big ‘problem’ in the 18th century and why sex was increasingly regulated from the 19th century. We chart the growth of new forms of sexual knowledge and ponder feminist critiques of Freud and other sex ‘experts’. We wind up in the twentieth century, with not one but several sexual revolutions. The course is designed for students in Women’s and Gender Studies and in History, but should appeal to anybody with an interest in one of the most studied and discussed aspects of modern life."

This course aims to take account of the abiding relevance of Austen's work in the early 21st century in two distinct but related ways. On the one hand, it focuses on Austen's juvenilia and novels as social and cultural products of their time. It examines how her works interact self-consciously with contemporary romantic, gothic and sentimental fiction as well as 'converse' with each other to form a dynamic and intellectually challenging body of work. On a more theoretical level, it explores the various components of Austen's literary style that allow her to speak to present-day readers: her use of irony, her ability to illuminate the subtle transformation of character over time, and her unique intermingling of romance and realism. Through these two lenses, the module demonstrates the continuing relevance of Austen's literary and moral worldview."

At some point during the eighteenth century, this question went from being more or less meaningless to one of the central preoccupations of Western literature and culture: the driving principle of countless—if not most—classic novels, and the occasion for many canonical works in other genres and media. The idea that the shape of an individual life follows a basic pattern of development, leading from the open-ended possibility of youth to the stable identity of adulthood, seems self-evident to us, but this idea has a history: it has been figured, configured and reconfigured in many different ways over the past 250 years, and continues to mutate and develop under our eyes today. The aim of this course is to track the related ideas of youth, adulthood and development over this period, as they are represented in key works of literature and cinema, and especially within the genre of the Bildungsroman. Our inquiry will be guided by the assumption that narratives of development, in prose, poetry and film, are not only passive reflections of reality, but rather that these literary and film representations are essential tools for making sense of our time-bound lives. Accordingly, your engagement with these questions will take the form of class discussion and a traditional essay, but also an original narrative in which you implement your understanding of the genre. The course is designed as a history of ideas and representations, but also as a toolkit, which will help us think about what it means to come of age in our own society and how best to approach the problem of education.  "

For forty years, the country was divided into communist East and capitalist West, until the fall of the Berlin Wall heralded the end of the Cold War. Since then, Germany has arguably become the European Union's leading power. This course explores social, cultural and political developments in Germany since 1945, with a focus on major contemporary and scholarly debates.

Excluded: ARTS2783",http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/general/2018/SSAPO/previousEditions.html,"Whether in public or academic discourse the notions of ‘modernity’ and ‘modern’ are ubiquitous. Yet what they mean is often far from clear. They designate a period, which extends to our own present, but the terms also refer to a set of concepts and contentious issues. Chief among these are the ideas of novelty and innovation, of rationalisation and secularism, but also of critique and disillusionment. Narratives of progress and emancipation compete with more somber analyses, frequently tinged by a nostalgia for what has been lost in the modern age. Taking its cue from Max Weber’s suggestion to think of the processes of modernisation as leading to the disenchantment of the world, the course looks at a series of prominent concepts that have been used to reflect on the idea of modernity and its implications. Readings will include the sociologist Max Weber on science, and on the Protestant ethic and capitalism; political theorists Carl Schmitt and Hannah Arendt on sovereignty, authority, and totalitarianism; the intellectual historian Reinhart Koselleck on the ideas of revolution and historical time; and the philosopher Peter Sloterdijk on the Nietzschean notion of ‘ressentiment’ – to name just a few."

You will be asked in this course to work out what these implications are, and how they have arisen, by examining the global political economy in a variety of forms, and through multiple perspectives. You will be encouraged to think reflectively and imaginatively about questions in the GPE for which there are no easy answers, including questions of power, privilege, common sense, instability and the ongoing role of crisis-driven capitalist growth.

Are emerging threats to international security really 'new'? If so, how should security studies scholars analyse them, and what are the implications for security praxis? How are policymakers dealing with these emerging or 'new' security challenges, to what effect, and what are some of the alternatives? These are some of the key questions explored in this course, which investigates the broad and evolving agenda of security studies, and key themes and dynamics in contemporary security relations. Using a range of conceptual and theoretical frameworks, the course asks you to examine issues such as new forms of warfare, sexualized violence in armed conflict, migration and identity, food security, climate change, and nuclear proliferation, and question whether these constitute 'new' security challenges. It asks what the implications of such an approach are for security relations at the state-societal level; the scholarly field of security studies, and the practice of security in policymaking terms. You are required to have a good level of familiarity with key security theories and concepts.

This seminar focuses on cultural identities – national, ethnic, religious and linguistic – in particular, and examines a range of scholarly and public debates provoked by these identities in seeming conflict. How should cultural identity fit within democratic states? Is the diversity associated with such identities compatible with the social solidarity needed for citizens to support collective goals like welfare programs? Do so-called nation-states have a right to protect their national identities and culture through restrictive immigration policies? Are liberal democratic states obliged to recognise the cultural identities and practices of its minorities? Should Indigenous groups be distinguished from immigrant groups? Should religious identity be treated differently from ethnic identity? Is multiculturalism bad for women, children, and animals? Should citizenship still be the foundation for addressing identity claims in democracies? By exploring how identities are constituted and situated in today’s highly mobile and interconnected world, this course asks how these identities shape world politics and offers you the opportunity to think carefully and reflectively about the relationship between various markers of identity and pressing questions in contemporary politics."

Over the last century, however, it has become institutionalised and professionalised and, as the disciplinary name Political Science suggests, has sought to put the study of politics on a footing comparable to the aims, methods, and conventions presumed integral to the natural sciences. Yet the possibility, desirability, and even meaning of a “science of politics” are controversial issues. This course examines fundamental questions about what political knowledge is and how it is acquired. In the first weeks, you will explore in a general way what it might mean to be a “student of politics.” You will learn about the different fields of political science and examine the idea of a systematic and dispassionate study of anything. You will consider the modern history of the discipline and identify the different and often conflicting perspectives regarding the appropriate aims, scope, and methods of political inquiry. Thereafter, the course will proceed each week by examining in detail a particular analytical perspective in conjunction with a real-world case study: behaviouralism, constructivism, interpretivism, institutionalism, rational choice theory, the structure versus agency problem, the relation between institutions, values and culture, and normative approaches."

You will explore how isolated and seemingly random pieces of data are actually embedded in larger frames of social and informational significance, and how crime scene investigation reflects sociological rules. You will explore the question of human agency and individual culpability, eyewitness testimony and memory, the relationship between individual behaviours and social norms, and how this material complicates our understanding of personhood, the nature of evidence, truth and social justice. You will also investigate “the two cultures problem” which divides scientific practices - with their attention on factual and objective evidence - from approaches in the humanities that underline the subjective and unreliable nature of truth claims. Several CSI tools, among them - forensic facial reconstruction, profiling, DNA, plant and insect evidence - will be introduced to illustrate the empirical and philosophical implications of these debates."

Students will engage in critiques of law as a reductionist discourse on the social by exploring the relationships between human rights and cultural differences such as gender, ethnicity, religion and indigenous cultures. The embodied self, social interdependency and the architecture of social institutions are the backdrop through which the course explores the tensions between universal and relativist understandings of human rights and their realization. Students will be introduced to the fundamentals of human rights, the global human rights machinery, and the ethics of humanitarian intervention, and will consider how sociologists and anthropologists have studied and written about human rights."

You will address the relationship between methods and methodology and recognise the importance of understanding the historical, theoretical and philosophical contexts from which particular research methods have emerged. Social researchers do not apply a set of neutral techniques to the issues they investigate, but rather research is part of a dynamic, engagement with social and cultural worlds with often deep connections to colonial thought and power. A heightened sense of the strategies used in researching culture and society enhances reflexivity among social researchers: that is, the capacity to reflect upon who we are, what we are doing; and the ethics of accountability. You will find that central to this course is the proposition that social research is a form of intervention in the social and cultural world, which may have major consequences on people’s lives. So too you will develop an understanding of your ‘subjective positioning’ and will come to find ways to decolonise your practice both through methods and methodologies. To do this you will engage with a wide source of information and knowledge and address decolonising principles and praxis."

In recent decades, however, theoretical feminism, critical race theory, and postcolonial theory have questioned this view of knowledge. In this course you will consider how race and gender is expressed in modes and styles of theorising. By claiming to be neutral, does a philosophy or theory exclude certain positions marked by social difference? If western traditions of thought are typically ‘masculine’ and ‘white,’ then (how) can academic philosophy accommodate the experiences of women and non-Europeans? How have philosophers historically represented racial and sexual difference? And what contributions can philosophy make to theorising race and gender in the contemporary world?"

In this course, students will experience first hand one of the major things that engineers do: designing and building creative solutions to problems. They will learn to think the way that engineers think, coming up with good solutions to problems despite being limited by budget, time and resources, the requirement to also meet environmental and social objectives and of course the limitations of the laws of physics. This will help them to appreciate the central ideas of engineering design as an on-time, on-budget and fit for purpose solution to a poorly specified, open-ended problem. They will be assigned to a team to work over a ten week period to solve a practical problem. The projects on offer change from year to year.  In doing all this they will start to build key skills for engineers that will be called upon repeatedly in their academic and professional lives, including concept development, critical thinking and evaluation skills, clear communication, research and information literacy skills and the skills involved in successfully functioning within a team environment to complete a given task.For further information please see ENGG1000

The course exposes students to this material through an examination of Australia’s hybrid constitutional inheritance from the United Kingdom and United States, as adapted in the creation and subsequent development of the federal Commonwealth. In doing so it also examines the implications of colonisation for Indigenous legal systems and assertions of Crown sovereignty. The role, powers and interrelationship of the three arms of government are considered in contemporary as well as historical context, as are the issues of rights protection and constitutional change.

The course explores the nature of the common law and common law reasoning, with a particular emphasis on the circumstances of the adoption of the common law in the Australian states, the common law’s role in facilitating dispossession, and the ongoing impact of colonisation for Indigenous people in Australia. It also explores the processes by which cases are decided by judges, introducing some theoretical frameworks that have been used to analyse law and legal decision making. The roles of judges, practising lawyers and other personnel in the court system are also considered, with an emphasis on the need for the development of professional identities and resilience, as well as the role of lawyers in promoting just outcomes.

This fosters the assumption that litigation, or legal advice predicting the outcome of litigation, is the normal method of resolving disputes. In fact only a small proportion of disputes are resolved by litigation Instead, there is a growing dissatisfaction with the cost, speed and adversarial character of litigation, and a corresponding interest in alternative forms of dispute resolution.

Legal practitioners, particularly in the civil society sector, are often called upon to lead, or contribute to public advocacy campaigns, and because of the increasing significance of the sector, their work on behalf of their organisations and stakeholders needs to be of a high professional and ethical standard. The course aims to provide the skills required to conduct public advocacy campaigns, in the context of a pluralistic democratic model, as well as developing students' ability to critically evaluate the public policy process. It also provides an introduction to the theoretical framework of democratic models, which are being contested in Australia today.Note: The course JURD7317 Strategic Public Advocacy for Civil Society (4 UOC) will be taught in conjunction with this course during the first 3 days."

In many nations of the Western world, reports of prostituted juveniles, young offenders accused of violent crimes and harms related to the new technologies have impacted on communities. In the South and in many countries in transition, the incidents of child soldiers, child sex tourism and trafficking of young people seem continuously to be highlighted in the media. Jurisprudence developing from the decisions of domestic courts, administrative tribunals and within international fora has provided insights into policy issues while at the same time offering contradictory messages on the legal responsibility and status of children. Because of this, there is a need to better understand the current status of the law and what your role may be – as lawyers, advocates or simply as concerned members of civil society – in ensuring that the rights of all citizens are respected, regardless of their age. It has been said that the phrase ""children’s rights"" is a slogan in search of a definition.

This includes recognising factors which shape the laws regarding inheritance and recognising where changes in those factors are likely to alter the needs of clients in matters like estate planning."

We examine what some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present-day have understood about the nature of justice. The focus will be not only on explaining and critically analyzing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law."

The amount at stake in these disputes regularly runs into billions of dollars. Philip Morris’ recent case against Australia arising from Australia’s tobacco plain packaging legislation is a high profile example. Supporters argue that investment treaties promote foreign investment and respect for the rule of law in countries that are bound by them. Critics argue that investment treaties constitute a ‘bill of rights for multinational corporations’ that is enforced through ‘secret courts’. "

This fosters the assumption that litigation, or legal advice predicting the outcome of litigation, is the normal method of resolving disputes. In fact only a small proportion of disputes are resolved by litigation and there is a growing dissatisfaction with the cost, speed and adversarial character of litigation, and a corresponding interest in alternative forms of non-adjudicative dispute resolution."

It begins by exploring the question “what is justice”? Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present and how they have understood justice. The focus here will be not only on explaining and critically analysing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law. The course will then put these ideas to work through a consideration of a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, how in modern circumstances might we ground the criteria of justice? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice? And what are we to make of various claims to justice, for instance, international justice, intergenerational justice, historical or transitional justice?"

Optimization problems, in which one wants to find the values of variables to maximize or minimize an objective function subject to constraints on which variables are allowed, are common throughout the physical and biological sciences, economics, finance and engineering. This course looks at the formulation of optimization problems as mathematical problems, characterizing solutions using necessary and/or sufficient optimality conditions and modern numerical methods and software for solving the problems. Both finite dimensional problems which involve a vector of variables, including linear and nonlinear programming, and infinite dimensional problems where the variables are functions, including optimal control problems, are covered.

Limits and continuity are the central concepts of calculus in one and several variables. These concepts can be extended to quite general situations. The simplest of these is when there is some way of measuring the distance between two objects. Some of the most important examples of these `metric spaces' occur as sets of functions, so this course looks at ways in which one might say that a sequence of functions converges. Taking these ideas one step further, we look at convergence which does not come from a generalised distance function. These are the ideas of point set topology. The course includes topics such as countability, continuity, uniform convergence and compactness, as well as an introduction to the core areas of function analysis. This includes the notions of Banach and Hilbert spaces, including Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces which are important in Applied Mathematics, Statistics and elsewhere.

The course follows a detailed case study that follows the life cycle of a medium-sized enterprise. The case study is designed to be realistic as well as rich in legal issues of relevance to all varieties of enterprise. The initial focus of the course will be to get students to consider the variety of relationships created by commercial activity and understand the way in which legal principles apply to these relationships. Thus the course will involve relationships among and between: Co-venturer Managers vis a vis shareholders, stakeholders, employees, consumers and regulators/government, ordinary commercial parties dealing at arm's length, citizens (including corporate citizens) and the State. The course will, aside from teaching students the essential principles of law in key areas (as derived from statutes and case law), teach students how to work with legal principles in a practical manner. We will therefore focus on the process of bargaining ""within the shadow of the law"", mediation and negotiation and use of extra-legal and self-help remedies as means of managing legal and business risks. The course will also require students to consider the way in which the law interacts with ethical and sound managerial practice. You will be exposed to legal issues as they emerge in the real world and learn how to be a more informed and efficient user of the services of legal professionals to manage those issues."

Universal though these truths might appear to be, the various musical expressions of the world’s peoples are as diverse, unique, and sometimes strange, as the natural and cultural worlds that make them. Today we can access that musical diversity easily. We can buy it, download it, iPod it. But just how much do we know about the peoples, histories, sentiments, and lives of the musicians and singers that produce this music?

But what do musicians do with their bodies, voices and instruments to get other bodies toe-tapping, dancing, or moshing? How do musicians and listeners become one, a communion, or a rite? We begin to answer these questions with the understanding that musical sound is a powerful force for social interaction (grooves, in a broader sense). At the same time, we address these questions with the understanding that here is no simple relationship between what musicians produce and the social and cultural meanings ascribed to their productions. Popular music may also be considered as a cultural text that is read, received, and interpreted by both individuals and groups."

This course provides instruction in the theory and practice of strategic planning as an integrative activity and adopts an applied focus in considering a contemporary multifaceted planning issue. The key drivers of change within our cities, for example housing supply and affordability, urban renewal, urban justice, infrastructure and transport, are unpacked, and the tensions that shape how decisions get made - or not - understood through the complex lens of urban governance and how planning - and planners - engaged with those we plan for. As planners we are interested in the inherently spatial dimensions of these urban processes, recognising that collective efforts to influence land use change and behaviours of urban stakeholders take place at different geographical scales, and impact on different groups in different ways.

In recent years, interest in maximising the strategic synergies between infrastructure expenditure and urban growth, development and renewal has become increasingly framed by the notion of 'city building'. The reassertion of strategic planning interests in the role that urban infrastructure projects play in 'city building' are acting to reposition the role of the planner, and demand a range of skills that help tie these large financial (and political) commitments more coherently to considerations of city productivity, efficiency and equity. This course introduces students to the centrality of transport and infrastructure considerations both within strategic and statutory contexts. The ongoing pipeline of major transport infrastructure projects in Australian cities offer an excellent lens through which to consider the increasingly integrative role planners play in key city shaping activities which have social, economic and environmental as much as mobility outcomes."

This broad perspective is important when considering (for example) the transparency of the Tax Office's decision-making practices, and the appropriateness of its compliance strategies and payment enforcement practices. Similarly, a broad perspective is required when considering the appropriateness of the dispute resolution avenues taxpayers have available to them. Correspondingly, a major theme running through the study materials is that all parties are part of a 'mass decision-making' tax regime, which requires an appropriate set of roles, obligations and 'checks and balances' on decision-making to ensure that both the underlying policy intent of the Commonwealth's taxation laws and 'procedural justice' are achieved."

The performance of our economy impacts on the availability of jobs, mortgage interest rates, the value of the Australian dollar, the prices we pay in the supermarket and our overall standard of living. As such, macroeconomic performance affects everyone. In this course we explore simplified models of the macroeconomy, and use deductive reasoning and available data, to try to understand how the various macroeconomic variables interact and produce the outcomes that so concern society as a whole. In particular, we concentrates on the interaction of the taxing and spending of government with the wider economy.

In addition, fixed public trusts, which are now commonly known as public unit trusts, funds or 'collective investment vehicles', have become a major form of public investment vehicle. Most superannuation funds are, in fact, trusts. The trust is not a distinct legal entity and is not taxed as a separate entity. The primary rule is that the beneficiary under a trust is subject to tax. Only where the beneficiary is not subject to tax will the trustee be assessed to pay tax. This course is mainly concerned with establishing when the primary rule applies, and when it is displaced by the exceptional rules. An understanding of the specific tax treatment of trusts is important to any student setting out to acquire, or refine, an understanding of the Australian tax system."

Indeed, there are significant advantages to contracting parties under various regimes (both tax and non-tax) for the parties to avoid their services relationship being one of employment. This course examines the taxation treatment of employee remuneration and closely analogous remuneration situations under various Australian taxation regimes. Central to the operation of many of these regimes is the presence of an employer/employee relationship, which is often contrasted with the principal/independent contractor relationship. Often, the latter relationship is not caught by the main taxation regimes. Remuneration for services also is often provided in non-cash form. This course examines all the key Australian tax regimes that apply to employee remuneration and situations closely analogous to employee remuneration. While the main focus is the various regimes under the federal income tax (e.g. employment termination payments, employee share schemes), the following are also covered: state payroll tax obligations of employers, superannuation guarantee obligations of employers and fringe benefits tax. In addition, there is also a focus on tax collection and remittance obligations of employers under the PAYG regime. Under the income tax, the course also examines the treatment of personal services income in the context of attempts to alienate such income (and reduce tax) through use of an interposed entity."

The focus of this course is on the tax treatment of taxable income and tax losses made through these three major entities. Even though tax policy suggests that similar treatment should be given to each economically equivalent entity, it is difficult to achieve this when designing operative tax rules. Hence, tax becomes a real factor in the all-important choice of entity question through which to operate an enterprise or hold investment assets. The course commences with some general law (non-tax) coverage of each entity, especially material factors in regard to the choice of entity question. It then moves to the income tax rules for each entity. Here the focus is on the tax rules relevant to the creation, operation and termination of partnerships, trusts and companies. The focus is on the tax rules that apply to closely held entities, and not widely held entities like listed trusts and listed companies."

The user of the FE method has to decide what kind of elements should be used, and how many of them? Where should the mesh be fine and where may it be coarse? Can the model be simplified? How accurate will the answers be, and how can they be checked? One need not understand all the mathematics of the finite element to answer these questions. However a competent user must have an understanding of the preliminary mathematics and must be able to understand how elements behave in order to choose suitable kinds, sizes and shapes of elements, and to guard against misinterpretations and unrealistically high expectations. This course is a balanced theoretical and practical introduction to the use of the FE method. The first chapter deals with matrix structural analysis, which is the ancestor of the finite element method. The second chapter deals with finite element approximation and numerical integration. The third chapter is an application of the finite element method to linear plane elasticity problems.

Politics may appear to be simply a struggle between different interests for 'who gets what', but ideas are important.

Such ideologies may be finished and everybody may nowadays be a democrat, yet people differ over what is just and free.  Ideas ground political institutions; they guide policies; and they shape political struggles.  This course investigates the foundational ideologies of modern politics - liberalism, conservatism and socialism - and explores the ideologies that contend with democratic systems, including feminism, multiculturalism and environmentalism.

The course also examines the impact of the war and mobilization on the home fronts, raising questions of leadership, morale and social change. Students will study life under foreign occupation and the difficulties this imposed on the defeated. The study of the Second World War raises many moral issues: amongst them, the barbarisation of warfare; the Final Solution; the choices of resistance and collaboration; the dropping of the first atomic bomb; and the trials and punishment at the end of the war. Students will examine different historical interpretations of these issues and engage in the arguments surrounding them."

The main schools of thought are reviewed to develop conceptual tools that will be used to analyse a range of non-traditional security issues such as energy security, environmental security, ethnic conflict and health security.

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s it has been one of the discipline’s fastest growth areas. What do cultural geographers do and why has there been this rapid growth? This course explores these questions by examining the concept of conflict. We will use this examination of the changing nature of the concept of conflict to think through how different understandings of conflict create different mechanisms of inclusions and exclusion through three different spatial scales: territory (maps and geographic representations), borders (security and no-man zones), and bodies (desire and difference). In what ways do territory, borders and bodies relate to each other? And how do they define the idea and instance of conflict? Cultural geography approaches such questions by examining the way meaning is constructed differently according to differences in times, spaces and places. "

This course will look at both natural and human-induced environmental hazards and what their study can tell us about how humans interact with the environment. We will look at how a number of concepts (e.g. privilege/poverty; time/change; scale/intensity; risk/vulnerability) can inform our understanding of both hazards and institutional reactions thereto. As members of the ADF, it is quite likely at some point you will be involved in a relief operation either in Australia or overseas. An understanding of the nature of hazards, hazard mitigation and emergency management will help to prepare you for participation in these activities.

This course covers three aspects of oceanography: waves, modelling and estuaries. Waves occur both on the surface of the ocean and within the ocean. Internal waves are important in mixing and sonar operations. After reviewing the basic principles of surface waves, this course presents the basics of internal waves, examining the dynamics, generation, propagation, and their impact on the ocean environment. Ocean modelling is a key component both in climate studies and naval operations. Basic modelling principles will be covered for both analytical and numerical ocean models with application to examples such as small-scale coastal systems, tsunamis, and the global ocean circulation. The dynamics of estuaries, embayments, and lagoons, and modelling of their flushing times and mixing regimes, in relation to the environmental quality of the land-sea margins may be introduced. This course may include a field school in Jervis Bay.
